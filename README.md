## About me

I am currently a third-year PhD student at the Information School of University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Jacob Thebault-Spieker](https://jacob.thebault-spieker.com) and the amazing members in the [Mad Collab](https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu). Before entering UW-Madison, I received my B.M. in Information Management Department and B.S. in Psychology Department from Peking University, under the supervision of [Prof. Pengyi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fL6FUdkAAAAJ&hl=en). Here is my [CV](https://zihanngao.github.io/zihangao_CV.pdf).

## Research Interest
My research focuses on the interplay between Human-in-the-Loop, Spatial Computing, and Social Computing. Moving to a new place often presents challenges that span the understanding of the local geography, culture, social integration, etc. My current projects aim to identify and address the gaps in local knowledge that newcomers face. The goal is to develop tools that leverage techniques from Human-Computer Interaction, Spatial Computing, and Machine Learning. These tools are designed to provide clear, quantifiable insights into local contexts at a large scale, making it easier for people to integrate and feel at home in new environments.
