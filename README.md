## About me

I am currently a third-year PhD student at the Information School of University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Jacob Thebault-Spieker](https://jacob.thebault-spieker.com) and the amazing members in the [Mad Collab](https://collab.ischool.wisc.edu). Before entering UW-Madison, I received my B.M. in Information Management Department and B.S. in Psychology Department from Peking University, under the supervision of [Prof. Pengyi Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fL6FUdkAAAAJ&hl=en). Here is my [CV](https://zihanngao.github.io/zihangao_CV.pdf).

## Research Interest
I have delved into understanding the complexities faced by individuals, particularly those undergoing significant social transitions like migration for employment and assimilating into unfamiliar terrains. My endeavors focus on deciphering nuanced, often implicit localness-centric information, trying to address the existing data voids in contemporary systems like LLMs. I aim to develop innovative tools that seamlessly bridge the divide between abstract notions, such as localness, and tangible, quantifiable data.
Furthermore, I have examined the ramifications of permanent suspensions on social media platforms. My research extends beyond a singular platform, shedding light on content moderation's ripple effects across the broader digital landscape. I am committed to unraveling the behaviors of deplatformed users and providing insights to inform judicious decision-making processes related to permanent suspensions, ensuring a balanced and inclusive digital ecosystem.
